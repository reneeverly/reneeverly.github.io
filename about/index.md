## Hi, I'm Ren√©e.
You might also know me as Raven or Veronika. I am a recent graduate with an M.A. in English Linguistics, having previously completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science. I have worked in a few industries from Engineering to Education and strive to promote interdisciplinary problem solving.
