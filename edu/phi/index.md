# Teaching Philosophy

Composition has historically sat as the terrifying gatekeeper of academia (Matsuda 638).  It "provided a continuing way to separate the unpredestined from those who belong [...] by encouraging them to leave school, or more vaguely, by convincing large numbers of native speakers and otherwise accomplished citizens that they are 'not good at English'," (Matsuda 638).  This concept is horrifying to think about as an educator, and the core of my philosophy for teaching is to subvert that entirely.  I strive to ensure that the barriers to entry are as low as they can go, to support students who may have difficulty engaging in traditional means by opening new avenues for engagement, and to clearly outline my expectations and how they can achieve them.
