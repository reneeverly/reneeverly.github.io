# Teaching Artifacts

## Artifact 1: Nearpod Integration

### Open Ended Questions

Getting students to raise their hands can be a challenge.  Offering a pseudo-anonymous question portal allows students who might be nervous or anxious to actually ask their question through a back channel.

### Poll Questions

Related is the question of having students raise their hands.  Most students who fall into the "Not Started Yet" category are going to be very unlikely to raise their hand if you ask who hasn't started on a project yet.  The pseudo-anonymous Nearpod integration comes to the rescue again.

## Artifact 2: Unit Schedule

![Two slides in a slide deck.  The first slide is a title slide, with the header Timeline (Reprise) and a line of sheet music.  The second slide includes a weekly timeline, showing the overarching task for each day.](res/timeline.png)

Keeping students engaged with the course content requires making them aware of the plans and connections between topics.
