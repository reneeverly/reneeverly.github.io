## Software

### Tiny Javascript Apps

Fairly simple JS apps that I drafted up for convenient calculators and whatnot.

{% include list_subpages.md %}

#### Older Tiny Apps

These are still single-file apps, but hosted in an older repository.

* [Monthly Calendar Printout](https://reneeverly.com/nawibo-blog/misc/calendar/)

### Small Javascript Apps

Large enough to have their own Git repositories.

* [HSV Color Picker](http://reneeverly.com/HSV-color-picker/)
* [HSY' Color Picker](https://reneeverly.com/HSYp-color-picker/)
* [Chord Name Finder](https://reneeverly.com/chord-name-finder/)
