### Testing OPAC
I've been kicking around the idea of properly cataloging all of the books in my collection and setting up a website to lend them out, much like a library.  I'm trying to see if jekyll can work for this purpose.  You can see the work in progress OPAC under [tiny-apps/opac/genre-tiles.html](/tiny-apps/opac/genre-tiles.html).

### Site Update
Replaced homepage with a tumblelog and added an optional dark mode (set by browser/os preference).

![A snowy scene with a blue-grey overcast sky.  Twigs are barely visible poking through the snow, and the right sides of tree trunks are coated in snow.  Smudges of water obscure small parts of the frame, as snow hits the camera.  A road with powerlines next to it runs from left to right, lightly plowed.](resources/100_9451.JPG)
