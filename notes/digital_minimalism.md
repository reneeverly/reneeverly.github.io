## Digital Minimalism
These are some notes and thoughts on reducing the amount of information you are overloaded with when using your computer.

### Web Browsing
#### Don't automatically reopen tabs from the last session. (Browser Setting)
The timeframe from you leaving that tab in the address bar and going back to research that topic is way too long to keep that tab open.  Set a bookmark or leave yourself some notes!  You'll be able to find that site again if/when you need it.

#### Delete anything in the Downloads folder older than 30 days. (Automation)
Most of the stuff that ends up in the downloads folder is one-time-use.  If you really need to keep it around, file it properly in your filesystem.

### Data Management
#### Keep your files contained, or keep track of where they are. (Storage)
If you need to reinstall your OS, or switch to a new computer, being able to backup or copy over a single folder is way easier than having to track down those important documents across your disk.  There are a few different spots you can put everything:

* Cloud sync folder (Automatic backup and synchronizes between computers).
* Non-cloud sync folder (No backup, but synchronizes between computers).
* External HDD / SD card / Flash Drive (You can easily move it to a new device).
* In your home / user folder (Application config files and data will tag along, though sometimes that can take up precious space).

#### Store files in year folders. (Storage and Archival)
I started doing this in 2018, and it helps with figuring out what I can start to prune or purge.  I probably don't need older years to be immediately accessible; Archive them by sending those folders to a cloud backup and burning them to a CD/DVD.  Then, I can delete them from my main system and free up disk space.
