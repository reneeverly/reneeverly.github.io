"9781250060174","Losing the signal: the untold story behind the extraordinary rise and spectacular fall of Blackberry","McNish, Jacquie","01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT"," ''In 2009, BlackBerry controlled half of the smartphone market. Today that number is less than one percent. What went so wrong? Losing the Signal is a riveting story of a company that toppled global giants before succumbing to the ruthlessly competitive forces of Silicon Valley. This is not a conventional tale of modern business failure by fraud and greed. The rise and fall of BlackBerry reveals the dangerous speed at which innovators race along the information superhighway. With unprecedented access to key players, senior executives, directors and competitors, Losing the Signal unveils the remarkable rise of a company that started above a bagel store in Ontario. At the heart of the story is an unlikely partnership between a visionary engineer, Mike Lazaridis, and an abrasive Harvard Business school grad, Jim Balsillie. Together, they engineered a pioneering pocket email device that became the tool of choice for presidents and CEOs. The partnership enjoyed only a brief moment on top of the world, however. At the very moment BlackBerry was ranked the world's fastest growing company internal feuds and chaotic growth crippled the company as it faced its gravest test: Apple and Google's entry in to mobile phones. Expertly told by acclaimed journalists, Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff, this is an entertaining, whirlwind narrative that goes behind the scenes to reveal one of the most compelling business stories of the new century''-- Provided by publisher."

"9780547416991","I'm feeling lucky: the confessions of Google employee number 59","Edwards, Douglas","01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT"," Comparing Google to an ordinary business is like comparing a rocket to an Edsel. Edwards, Employee Number 59, offers the first inside view of Google, giving readers a chance to fully experience the bizarre mix of camaraderie and competition at this phenomenal company. Edwards, Google's first director of marketing and brand management, describes it as it happened. We see the first, pioneering steps of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the company's young, idiosyncratic partners; the evolution of the company's famously nonhierarchical structure (where every employee finds a problem to tackle or a feature to create and works independently); the development of brand identity; the races to develop and implement each new feature; and the many ideas that never came to pass."

"9780671526016","Hitchcock","Truffaut, François","01 Jan 1984 00:00:00 GMT"," Any book-length interview with Alfred Hitchcock is valuable, but considering that this volume's interlocutor is fellow director François Truffaut, the conversation is remarkable indeed. Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch's films in succession. Though this book was initially published in 1967 when Hitchcock was still active, Truffaut later prepared a revised edition that covered the final stages of his career. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism, including the master's impressions of a classic like Rear Window (''I was feeling very creative at the time, the batteries were well charged''), his technical insight into Psycho's shower scene (''the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]''), and his ruminations on flops such as Under Capricorn (''If I were to make another picture in Australia today, I'd have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell 'Follow that car!''')."

"9780762461714","I love my computer because my friends live in it: stories from an online life","Kimball Leslie, Jess","01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT"," ''I Love My Computer Because My Friends Live in It is tech analyst Jess Kimball Leslie's hilarious, frank homage to the technology that contributed so significantly to the person she is today. From accounts of the lawless chat rooms of early AOL to the perpetual high school reunions that are modern-day Facebook and Instagram, her essays paint a clear picture: That all of us have a much more twisted, meaningful, emotional relationship with the online world than we realize or let on. Coming of age in suburban Connecticut in the late '80s and early '90s, Jess looked to the nascent Internet to find the tribes she couldn't find IRL: fellow Bette Midler fans; women who seemed impossibly sure of their sexuality; people who worked with computers every day as part of their actual jobs without being ridiculed as nerds. It's in large part because of her embrace of an online life that Jess is where she is now, happily married, with a wife, son, and dog, and making a living of analyzing Internet trends and forecasting the future of tech. She bets most people would credit technology for many of their successes, too, if they could only shed the notion that it's as a mind-numbing drug on which we're all overdosing''-- Provided by publisher.

"9781629142067","Secrets of making and breaking codes: a hands-on guide to both simple and sophisticated codes to easily help you become a codemaster","Nickels, Hamilton","01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT"," ''Ever since humans first began to communicate, we've had secrets to keep -- secrets of state, war, business, or the heart. From the moment the first secret message was sent, others were busy trying to decipher it. By rearranging, substituting, or transposing symbols, any message can be encoded or decoded -- if you know how. Secrets of Making and Breaking Codes is a practical field manual designed to teach you the basic mechanics of enciphering and deciphering communications. The author has used his extensive knowledge of and experience in electronic communications and languages -- as well as his decades of fascination with secret codes -- to demystify the field of cryptology. Hamilton Nickels uses plain, uncomplicated English and simple, workable systems that rely on neither advanced mathematics, nor on ethereal philosophies. This is the only hands-on guide to both the simplest cipher schemes -- that need little more than scratch paper and a pencil to crack -- as well as more sophisticated codes that use one-time code books, pocket calculators, and the most advanced computer-based systems used by the military and diplomatic corps of most governments. Letting the wrong eyes see a secret message can often make the difference between victory and defeat, success and failure, life and death. Secrets of Making and Breaking Codes will make mastering codes easier''-- Provided by publisher."
